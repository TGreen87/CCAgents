# Orchestration System Cohesion Test

## Current State Summary

### ✅ Implemented
1. **Agent Registry**: 17 agents total (9 new + 8 existing)
2. **Orchestration Hub**: CLAUDE.md transformed
3. **Telemetry System**: telemetry.log created with examples
4. **Agent-First Routing**: ORCHESTRATOR.md updated

### ❌ Missing Critical Components

#### 1. Telemetry Integration (8 agents missing)
- code-reviewer.md
- deployment-engineer.md  
- frontend-excellence.md
- memory-manager.md
- qa-tester.md
- research-docs-api.md
- software-architect.md
- taskmaster.md

#### 2. Command Integration (0% complete)
- No commands have orchestration configuration
- No automatic agent delegation defined
- No default agent mappings

#### 3. Concrete Implementation Gaps
- Agent selection algorithm not implemented
- No automatic routing from request → agent
- No health monitoring system
- No failure recovery chains

## Automation Readiness: 25%

The system has good structure but lacks the critical connections needed for automation:

1. **Agent Invocation**: Manual only (no auto-routing)
2. **Telemetry**: Partial (53% of agents integrated)
3. **Command Routing**: Not implemented
4. **Health Monitoring**: Not implemented
5. **Failure Recovery**: Described but not implemented

## Test Case

If a user says "implement user authentication", the system should:
1. ❌ Automatically detect security + backend domains
2. ❌ Route to security-auditor + api-designer + database-engineer
3. ❌ Log to telemetry
4. ❌ Monitor progress
5. ❌ Synthesize outputs

Currently, none of this happens automatically.

## Next Steps for Cohesion

1. **Complete telemetry integration** (8 agents)
2. **Implement command orchestration** (all commands)
3. **Create agent selection logic** (concrete implementation)
4. **Build health monitoring** (agent availability)
5. **Test end-to-end automation**
