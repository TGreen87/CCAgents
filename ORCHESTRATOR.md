# ORCHESTRATOR.md - SuperClaude Agent-First Orchestration System

**Primary Directive**: Every request must be evaluated for agent delegation. Claude Code orchestrates; agents execute.

## ðŸŽ¯ Agent-First Detection Engine

Analyzes ALL requests to identify optimal agent delegation strategies. Default behavior is multi-agent orchestration unless explicitly overridden.

### Agent Delegation Decision Flow

```yaml
request_analysis:
  1_immediate_delegation_check:
    if: "request matches agent expertise"
    then: "delegate to specialist agent"
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    
  2_multi_agent_evaluation:
    if: "request spans multiple domains"
    then: "coordinate multiple agents"
    max_agents: 10
    
  3_fallback_strategy:
    if: "no specialist matches"
    then: "delegate to general-purpose"
    never: "execute directly unless --single-agent"
```

### Pre-Operation Validation Checks

**Agent Availability Check** (NEW):
- Verify required agents are available
- Check agent health status from telemetry
- Confirm resource availability for delegation
- Prepare fallback chain if primary unavailable

**Resource Validation**:
- Token usage prediction based on operation complexity and scope
- Memory and processing requirements estimation
- File system permissions and available space verification
- MCP server availability and response time checks

**Compatibility Validation**:
- Flag combination conflict detection (e.g., `--no-mcp` with `--seq`)
- Persona + command compatibility verification
- Tool availability for requested operations
- Project structure requirements validation

**Risk Assessment**:
- Operation complexity scoring (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Failure probability based on historical patterns
- Resource exhaustion likelihood prediction
- Cascading failure potential analysis

**Validation Logic**: Resource availability, flag compatibility, risk assessment, outcome prediction, and safety recommendations. Operations with risk scores >0.8 trigger safe mode suggestions.

**Resource Management Thresholds**:
- **Green Zone** (0-60%): Full operations, predictive monitoring active
- **Yellow Zone** (60-75%): Resource optimization, caching, suggest --uc mode
- **Orange Zone** (75-85%): Warning alerts, defer non-critical operations  
- **Red Zone** (85-95%): Force efficiency modes, block resource-intensive operations
- **Critical Zone** (95%+): Emergency protocols, essential operations only

### Pattern Recognition Rules

#### Complexity Detection
```yaml
simple:
  indicators:
    - single file operations
    - basic CRUD tasks
    - straightforward queries
    - < 3 step workflows
  token_budget: 5K
  time_estimate: < 5 min

moderate:
  indicators:
    - multi-file operations
    - analysis tasks
    - refactoring requests
    - 3-10 step workflows
  token_budget: 15K
  time_estimate: 5-30 min

complex:
  indicators:
    - system-wide changes
    - architectural decisions
    - performance optimization
    - > 10 step workflows

### Intent Extraction Algorithm
```
1. Parse user request for keywords and patterns
2. Match against domain/operation matrices
3. Score complexity based on scope and steps
4. Evaluate wave opportunity scoring
5. Estimate resource requirements
6. Generate routing recommendation (traditional vs wave mode)
7. Apply auto-detection triggers for wave activation
```

**Enhanced Wave Detection Algorithm**:
- **Flag Overrides**: `--single-wave` disables, `--force-waves`/`--wave-mode` enables
- **Scoring Factors**: Complexity (0.2-0.4), scale (0.2-0.3), operations (0.2), domains (0.1), flag modifiers (0.05-0.1)
- **Thresholds**: Default 0.7, customizable via `--wave-threshold`, enterprise strategy lowers file thresholds
- **Decision Logic**: Sum all indicators, trigger waves when total â‰¥ threshold

## ðŸš¦ Routing Intelligence

Dynamic decision trees that map detected patterns to optimal tool combinations, persona activation, and orchestration strategies.

### P2SA (Persona-to-SubAgent) Framework

**Multi-Agent Orchestration System** transforming personas into coordinated specialist teams.

**Core Components**:
- **Delegation Engine**: Analyzes tasks and assigns to optimal agents
- **Board Manager**: Visual task tracking with Kanban-style workflow
- **Agent Coordinator**: Manages inter-agent communication and handoffs
- **Resource Tracker**: Monitors system resources with graceful degradation

**P2SA Activation Logic**:
```yaml
p2sa_activation:
  automatic: # DEFAULT - ALWAYS ACTIVE
    - complexity >= 0.3 OR domains >= 1  # Much lower thresholds
    - ANY multi-step operation (>2 steps)
    - ANY multi-file operation
    - DEFAULT unless explicitly disabled
  modes:
    multi_agent: "DEFAULT - Full P2SA orchestration"
    hybrid: "Lead persona with supporting agents"
    single_agent: "RARE - Requires explicit --single-agent flag"
```

**Agent Selection Algorithm**:
```yaml
agent_score = 
  domain_match * 0.35 +
  expertise_level * 0.25 +
  availability * 0.20 +
  past_performance * 0.15 +
  resource_cost * 0.05
```

**Board States**:
- **Backlog**: Tasks awaiting assignment
- **In Progress**: Active agent execution
- **Review**: Quality validation phase
- **Done**: Completed with metrics

### Wave Orchestration Engine
Multi-stage command execution with compound intelligence. Automatic complexity assessment or explicit flag control. Now integrated with P2SA for agent-based wave execution.

**Wave Control Matrix**:
```yaml
wave-activation:
  automatic: "complexity >= 0.7"
  explicit: "--wave-mode, --force-waves"
  override: "--single-wave, --wave-dry-run"
  p2sa_default: "Multi-agent execution for ALL wave operations"
  
wave-strategies:
  progressive: "Incremental enhancement"
  systematic: "Methodical analysis"
  adaptive: "Dynamic configuration"
```

**Wave-Enabled Commands**:
- **Tier 1**: `/analyze`, `/build`, `/implement`, `/improve`
- **Tier 2**: `/design`, `/task`

## âš¡ Performance Optimization

Resource management, operation batching, and intelligent optimization for sub-100ms performance targets.

**Token Management**: Intelligent resource allocation based on unified Resource Management Thresholds (see Detection Engine section)

**Operation Batching**:
- **Tool Coordination**: Parallel operations when no dependencies
- **Context Sharing**: Reuse analysis results across related routing decisions
- **Cache Strategy**: Store successful routing patterns for session reuse
- **Task Delegation**: Intelligent sub-agent spawning for parallel processing
- **Resource Distribution**: Dynamic token allocation across sub-agents

**Resource Allocation**:
- **Detection Engine**: 1-2K tokens for pattern analysis
- **Decision Trees**: 500-1K tokens for routing logic
- **MCP Coordination**: Variable based on servers activated


## ðŸ”— Integration Intelligence

Smart MCP server selection and orchestration.

### MCP Server Selection Matrix
**Reference**: See MCP.md for detailed server capabilities, workflows, and integration patterns.

**Quick Selection Guide**:
- **Context7**: Library docs, framework patterns
- **Sequential**: Complex analysis, multi-step reasoning
- **Magic**: UI components, design systems
- **Playwright**: E2E testing, performance metrics

### Intelligent Server Coordination
**Reference**: See MCP.md for complete server orchestration patterns and fallback strategies.

**Core Coordination Logic**: Multi-server operations, fallback chains, resource optimization

### Persona Integration
**Reference**: See PERSONAS.md for detailed persona specifications and MCP server preferences.

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Protocols

Handling resource constraints and failures gracefully.

### Resource Management
Threshold-based resource management follows the unified Resource Management Thresholds (see Detection Engine section above).

### Graceful Degradation
- **Level 1**: Reduce verbosity, skip optional enhancements, use cached results
- **Level 2**: Disable advanced features, simplify operations, batch aggressively
- **Level 3**: Essential operations only, maximum compression, queue non-critical

### Error Recovery Patterns
- **MCP Timeout**: Use fallback server
- **Token Limit**: Activate compression
- **Tool Failure**: Try alternative tool
- **Parse Error**: Request clarification

  3_delegate_task: "Use Task tool for delegation"
  4_monitor_progress: "Track via telemetry"
  5_synthesize_output: "Combine agent results"
  
never:
  - "Execute directly without agent evaluation"
  - "Ignore specialist when available"
  - "Skip telemetry logging"
```

### Optimal Agent Combinations

### Telemetry-Driven Improvements
- Monitor agent performance metrics
- Identify bottlenecks and failures
- Adjust routing based on success rates
- Continuously optimize agent selection
